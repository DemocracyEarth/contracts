# Liquid Democracy

> ðŸš¨ðŸš§ _Everything in this repo is still a work in progress and higly experimental. It is not secure to use any of this code in production (mainnet) until proper security audits have been conducted._

This is a smart contract implementation of a basic liquid democracy with three initial main functionalities: `vote()`, `delegate()` and `revoke()`. It mainly consists of `LiquidDemocracy.sol` and its corresponding test file `LiquidDemocracy.test.js`. This is the starting point of a roadmap that seeks to bridge Sovereign app with blockchain features. Please make sure you check out the [Waffle board](https://waffle.io/DemocracyEarth/contracts) and the [milestones](https://github.com/DemocracyEarth/contracts/milestones) for more information.
