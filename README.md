# Liquid Democracy as a smart contract

> ðŸš¨ðŸš§ _Everything in this repo is still a work in progress and higly experimental. It is not secure to use any of this code in production (mainnet) until proper security audits have been conducted._

This is a smart contract implementation (dapp) in the Ethereum blockchain of a [liquid democracy](https://github.com/DemocracyEarth/paper) with three initial main functionalities: `vote()`, `delegate()` and `revoke()`. It mainly consists of `LiquidDemocracy.sol` and its corresponding test file `LiquidDemocracy.test.js`. This is the starting point of a roadmap that seeks to bridge [Sovereign app](https://github.com/DemocracyEarth/sovereign) with blockchain features. Please make sure you check out the [project board](https://github.com/DemocracyEarth/dapp/projects/3) and the [milestones](https://github.com/DemocracyEarth/dapp/milestones) for more information.

The most recent version of the dapp is available at http://dapp.democracy.earth. For desktop usage, you will need Metamask and a Metamask-supported browser to be able to interact with it. For mobile usage, use a dapp browser / wallet like [Toshi](https://www.toshi.org/).

## Contributing

PRs and feedback are welcomed. A good place to start is to review the current [open issues](https://github.com/DemocracyEarth/dapp/issues), please feel free to engage with us by commenting in a specific issue. Remember you can also check out the [project board](https://github.com/DemocracyEarth/dapp/projects/3) to understand what's being worked on now and what is coming up next.

Dapp development is discussed actively in the slack channel [#developers](https://democracyearth.slack.com/messages/C5KCH0PD1) in democracyearth.slack.com 

The dapp consists of mailnly two elements, contracts and frontend, located respectively in the following folders:
- **contracts**: Solidity contracts, to be deployed to a local or remote blockchain.
- **dApp-Srv-Exp**: JS frontend built using npm, bower and http-server

## Development dependencies

- NodeJS (make sure you have the latest version of npm, using `npm i -g npm`)
  - Bower (`npm install -g bower`)
  - Truffle (`npm install -g truffle`)
  - http-server (`npm install -g http-server`)
- Ganache (http://truffleframework.com/ganache/)
- Metamask browser extension (https://metamask.io/)

## How to run

### Compile, deploy and copy compiled contracts to frontend

Choose the environment.
Use *development* for local environment (start ganache before) or *ropsten* for Ropsten Ethereum test network in remote environment.

 ```sh
 $ npm install
 $ truffle compile
 $ truffle migrate --network [development / ropsten]
 $ cp build/contracts/* dApp-Svr-Exp/contracts/
 ```
 
### Start frontend

```sh
$ http-server dApp-Svr-Exp/
```

### Access

You will be able to access the dapp at http://localhost:8080 in development mode. Make sure to set Metamask to the right environment (private network or Ropsten), and also make sure to provision necessary gas for each case:

#### Local environment

Import private keys from Ganache into Metamask (Accounts -> Import account)

#### Remote environment

Use a Ropsten faucet. e.g.: http://faucet.ropsten.be:3001/
